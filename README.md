# Overview
These codes were used in the experiments of our study, ``Multi-label Classification by Interdependence Model.``
In this study, we proposed ``interdependence model`` for multi-label classification. This method can clearly deal with relationship between labels to predict the labels.

## Description

## Demo

```
from download_datasets.multilabel_datasets import load_scene

# load scene dataset if you have; otherwise download scene zip, unzip the file, and load the data.
data = load_scene()

# feature data
X = data.features()

# label data
y = data.labels()
```
